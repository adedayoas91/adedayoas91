# Hi there 👋

### About me
I am a self-motivated, goal-driven, and passionate MultiCloud DevOps Engineer. That might sound overwhelming😅, trust me, I know!🫣. However, I hope to shed light on that over the following few lines of this write-up🤗). 

🏃‍♂️ I am currently pursuing a doctoral degree at the Faculty of Computer Science of the University of Vienna. I am researching at the intersection of Machine Learning, Statistics (Causal Inference), Signal processing, and Neuroscience 

👩‍🎓 My background is in Mechanical Engineering (Bachelor) and Biomedical Engineering (Masters). I am very passionate about information technology (IT), Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
I am comfortable handling tasks alone and equally effective in team(s). I learn best via challenges. I have an eye for detail and enjoy problem-solving using proven solutions to real-life problems. Adapts and excels with challenges and changes, as apparent from my career path, and have chosen to explore the world of IT (DevOps) after some years in research. When not working or learning, 

I enjoy playing and watching football (soccer), cooking new recipes, cycling, and many more. This passion drives me daily as I constantly strive to be the best at what I do through continuous learning.
